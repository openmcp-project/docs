# About openMCP

👋 Welcome to the documentation of openMCP. It's part of [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/) which is an Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS).

<!-- vale Google.Headings = NO -->
## 🌐 ApeiroRA?
<!-- vale Google.Headings = YES -->

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request, and consume services and for service providers to describe, offer, and provision their services.

By being open source, ApeiroRA provides a cross-border spillover effect, solidifying the foundation and future of the project.

Learn more about ApeiroRA by checking out the official website at [https://apeirora.eu/](https://apeirora.eu/).

## 🤝 openMCP and ApeiroRA
<!-- vale Google.Headings = YES -->

The Open Managed Control Plane (openMCP) enables extensible Infrastructure- and Configuration-as-Data capabilities as a Service. Based on the Kubernetes Resource Model, all resources in the cloud-edge continuum with ApeiroRA are accessible and managed via a declarative API and corresponding controllers and operators. Together with the controller which understand OCM and declarative deployment orchestrators, consumers can subscribe to a product release-train of software producers and implement an automated, GitOps-driven deployment workflow at the edges.
